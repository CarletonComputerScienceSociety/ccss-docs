<h1>Volunteering with the CCSS</h1>

The CCSS is an entirely student run Society. Our Board, Committees, etc. are
all staffed and managed by Undergrad CS students at Carleton. If you'd like to
help put on the events you know and love, help manage services that you find
valuable, or be on the spear-front of new CCSS developments then you should
volunteer with the CCSS!

Volunteering with the CCSS is fun, usually easy, and goes on your Co-Curricular
Record! If you like to register to volunteer with us then just fill out this
[Google Form](http://goo.gl/forms/7VuHBF3HXG) and we'll get back to you by
email when we need awesome help!

If instead you're looking to start a venture, or get in on the decision making
process for how we do things, then browse our list of Committees to find the
right one for yourself.

Happy Volunteering!
