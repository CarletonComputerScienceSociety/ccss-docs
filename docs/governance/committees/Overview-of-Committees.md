<h1>Committees of the CCSS</h1>

All of the services, events, etc. that are provided by the CCSS are provided
through committees with relevant mandates. If you want something done, done
differently, or changed then connecting with the committee in charge of the
task is critical.

If there is no committee in charge of providing a service on the behalf of the
CCSS to its membership, any member of the CCSS may organize a committee to do
so by the requirements of the [Constitution](../Constitution.md) and the [Rules
of Operation](../Rules-of-Operation.md).

Check out the [committee listing](./List-of-Committees.md) to see if what
you're interested in is already on the go!
