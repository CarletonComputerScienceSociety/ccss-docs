<h1>Officers of the CCSS</h1>

Officers of the CCSS are members assigned by the Board of Directors or by a
committee to semi-independently fulfill a mandate of the Board or that
committee.

They may have powers within the Society that are greater than that of a regular
member within, and for the purposes of completing, their mandate.

If you are looking for information on an endeavour of the CCSS or would like to
assist in the completion of one then finding the Officer in charge of that
endeavour is usually a good place to start.

Below you will find a current short-list of all Officers of the CCSS.
