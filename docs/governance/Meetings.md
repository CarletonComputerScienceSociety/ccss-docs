<h1>Meetings of the CCSS</h1>

The CCSS holds regular meetings at a variety of different levels to maintain
cohesive activity. Meetings regularly held and information about them can be
found here.

## General Meetings

*See the [Constitution](./Constitution.md) for information about General
meetings*

## Meetings of the Board

The Board of Directors meets at least once a month. Full and Limited members of
the CCSS may attend meetings of the Board to listen and, at the discretion of
the Board, may also be invited to participate. Only members of the Board of
Directors have voting power at these meetings.

*Current schedules are in flux. Contact the Vice-President for information on
the next date on which the Board will meet.*

## Committee Meetings

Committee meeting times are entirely up to the committee holding them. Check on
the [individual committee's page](./committees/List-of-Committees.md) for an
accurate meeting time or a contact for that committee so you may inquire about
their next meeting time.
