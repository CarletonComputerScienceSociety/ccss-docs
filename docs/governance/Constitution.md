# Carleton Computer Science Society Constitution

## Name

The name of the Academic Society shall be the Carleton Computer Science
Society, hereafter referred to as the Society.

## Objects

The objects of the Society shall be:

  * to engage Carleton University’s School of Computer Science undergraduate
    students in social and academic activities.
  * to provide services for those students to aid in their academic career at
    Carleton.
  * to represent those students to the Carleton University community.

## Powers

To further the objects above and nothing else, the Board of Directors may
exercise the power to:

  1. Promote the health and wellbeing of Carleton University’s School of
    Computer Science undergraduate students while following Carleton
    University’s Human rights policies part 1, section 8.
  2. Invite and receive contributions and raise funds where appropriate and
    within the guidelines given by the School of Computer Science and
    Carleton University, to finance the work of the Society, and to open a
    bank account to manage such funds.
  3. Publicise and promote the work of the Society and organise meetings,
    training workshops, events or seminars, etc.
  4. Employ staff and volunteers (who shall not be members of the Board of
    Directors) as necessary to conduct activities to fulfil the objects.
    Volunteers must hold status as members of the Society.
  5. Work with groups of similar nature and exchange information, advice, and
    knowledge with them, including cooperation with other academic societies,
    voluntary bodies, charities, statutory and non-statutory organisations.
  6. Take any form of action that is both within the restrictions of an
    academic society as defined by Carleton University and lawful when
    necessary to achieve the objects of the Society.

## Membership

1. Full Membership includes all currently registered students of the Carleton
  University Computer Science undergraduate program.

2. Temporary Limited Membership (as defined by the Society’s Rules of
  Operation) is open to anyone who has interest in assisting the Society with
  its goals, is willing to adhere to the rules of the Society, and is accepted
  by the Board of Directors (following the relevant Rules of Operation).

3. Limited membership also includes all alumni students of the Carleton
  University Computer Science undergraduate program.

4. Where it is considered membership would be detrimental to the goals and
  activities of the Society, the Board of Directors may temporarily suspend the
  membership of any member by a motion passed at a meeting of the Board. In the
  event that a member has violated Carleton University's codes of conduct, or
  the codes of conduct of the Society (if defined by the Rules of Operation),
  their membership will be temporarily suspended without requiring a motion.

5. In the case that a member considers membership of another to be detrimental
  to the goals and activities of the Society, that member may collect
  signatures of the membership in the form of a petition to present the Board
  of Directors. This petition must have a minimum of three (3) times the number
  of elected Directors of the Board in signatures to be valid. After the
  petition is presented to the Board of Directors, The Board must review, by
  the next meeting of the Board of Directors, the member under question and
  move forward as described by the point above.

6. Temporary membership statuses will be presented to the membership at the
  next available general meeting (within the current society year) where the
  membership will then vote whether or not to make that status permanent after
  a 51 percent majority vote.

7. Temporary changes in a student’s membership status may be reversed by the
  Board of Directors at any of meeting of the Board of Directors.

8. Any member may resign their (full or limited) membership by providing the
  Vice-President, or their designate(s), with written notice.

## Management

The Society will be administered by a Board of Directors of no less than five
(5) elected directors and no more than ten (10) elected directors, all of which
must hold full membership. Directors will be elected for a period of one
academic year as defined by the Carleton School of Computer Science and
Carleton University.

Should the Board of Directors ever number less than minimum, an emergency
election must be called to fill the necessary positions. Until the emergency
election is completed and the minimum number of Directors is met, all
non-essential services and operations will be suspended.

Rules of Operation, provided it is accompanied by a valid Terms of Reference
document (following the requirements as detailed in the Rules of Operation).
All Terms of Reference documents for a committee must have the following
