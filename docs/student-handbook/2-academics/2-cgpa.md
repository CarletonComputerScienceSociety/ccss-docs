<h1>How to Calculate Your CGPA </h1>

Note: Your Overall CGPA is calculated from all the courses you have taken,
but your Major CGPA is only calculated from the courses for your Major
Requirements.  These courses are listed in Section A of the [course
calendar](http://calendar.carleton.ca/undergrad/undergradprograms/computerscience/)
or can be found in your audit underneath “Major Requirements.”

To calculate your minor CGPA, follow the same steps but with the courses
for your minor.

The Norman Paterson School of International Affairs provides a
simple [guide](https://carleton.ca/npsia/calculate-your-gpa/) for
calculating your CGPA.
