<h1> Top 5 Study Spots </h1>

<dl>
	<dt> MacOdrum Library </dt>
	<dd> A classic and the best, you can book a study room at [booking.carleton.ca](http://booking.carleton.ca)</dd>

	<dt> Stairwell behind Southam Theatre A </dt>
	<dd> Find it if you dare!</dd>

	<dt> Third Floor River Building Atrium </dt>
	<dd> By the giant windows.  There's no tables but the sunlight feels amazing all year round </dd>

	<dt> Underneath Canal Building </dt>
	<dd> Or underneath other buildings in the tunnels, if you don't mind the underground feels. There are several tables all over the place, find your favourite spot or the one closest to your classes! </dd>

	<dt> Home </dt>
	<dd> Home is where the heart is, and there are no friends to distract you. Create a dedicated study space, away from the tempting influence of your warm, snuggly bed. </dd>

The worst place to study on campus? The CCSS Lounge, sorry.  It's a pretty social, distracting, noisy place.
