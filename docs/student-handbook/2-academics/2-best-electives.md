> Top 5 Electives
> 1. Introduction to Symbolic Logic (PHIL 2001) - This course is effectively the first two weeks of COMP 1805 stretched into a course. Pretty glorious.
> 2. Mysteries of the Mind (CGSC 1001) - A very interesting course, but it fills up really quickly
> 3.  Dinosaurs (ERTH 2401) - Need I say more?
> 4. Survey of Accounting (BUSI 1003) - Another course in Ornithology
> 5. Ancient Science and Technology (TSES 2305) - A 1.0 credit course thatâ€™s light *and* interesting.
> <p>The worst: Anything you're not interested in. If someone says it's easy marks but it's the most boring thing you've ever heard of, don't do it!</p>
