> ## CCSS Top Five Study Spots
> 1. Library - a classic and the best, you can book a study room at [the booking site](http://booking.carleton.ca).
> 2. Stairwell behind Southam Theatre A. Find it if you dare!
> 3. Third floor River Building, by the giant windows.  There’s no tables but the sunlight feels great.
> 4. Underneath Canal Building.
> 5. Home.  Home is where the heart is and there’s no friends to distract you.  But there is a bed.  A nice, comfy warm bed.  You should go to sleep right now.  Sleeeeeeeeeeeep.
> <p>The worst: The CCSS lounge. The lounge is a great place for socializing and making friends but not so good for actual studying.</p>
