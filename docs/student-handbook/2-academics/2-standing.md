<h1>Understanding Your Standing</h1>

Each year, your CGPA is compared against the minimum requirements for your
degree program to determine whether or not you can continue in the program.

To understand more about your academic standing (at Carleton, this is also
referred to as your Academic Performance
Evaluation) the SASC provides a [list of possible 
standings](https://carleton.ca/sasc/advisingcentre/academic-standing/) and what
they mean.

There is a minimum overall CGPA you must maintain to remain in good
standing.  Included here is a chart of the minimum required overall CGPA for
Computer Science students.  The minimum required overall CGPA for good
standing can be found in [Carleton regulations](http://www3.carleton.ca/calendars/ugrad/0910/regulations/acadregsuniv7.html#7.4).
