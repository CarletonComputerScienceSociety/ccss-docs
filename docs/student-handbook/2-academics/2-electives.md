<h1>What the frack is an elective?</h1>

Electives are courses that are required for the completion of your degree but
aren't preselected. You can pick and choose them from the huge list of courses
that Carleton offers. There are a couple of restrictions though, the SCS provides a [guide on selecting  electives](http://www.scs.carleton.ca/current-students/undergraduate-students/bcs-choosing-electives) for Computer Science students and includes a list of restrictions.


A tip for choosing electives is to choose electives that you find interesting and are
classes you would attend.  If you don't play your strengths, you might find your electives
dragging down your CGPA, which is pretty unmotivating.  By taking electives that sound
interesting, you might find that you have enough to pursue a minor in something you never
expected!

> Tip: you cannot include more than 7.0 1000-level credits in your degree.
