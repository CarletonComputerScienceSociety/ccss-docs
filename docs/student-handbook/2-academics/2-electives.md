*What the frack is an elective?

Electives are courses that are required for the completion of your degree but
aren't predetermined. You can pick and choose them from the huge list of courses
that Carleton offers. There are a couple of restrictions though. The types of 
electives and the restrictions on choosing them can be found on

A tip for choosing electives is to choose electives that you find interesting and are 
classes you would attend.  If you don't play your strengths, you might find your electives 
dragging down your CGPA, which is pretty unmotivating.  By taking electives that sound
interesting, you might find that you have enough to pursue a minor in something you never
expected!
