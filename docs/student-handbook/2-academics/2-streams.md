<h1>Crossing the Streams</h1>

As an honours student, you get to choose a stream to add to your degree.
Streams add a couple of specialized courses to your degree requirements that
focus on teaching you the intricacies of the specific stream that you registered
for. Just for clarification, I want to add that streams don't make a huge
difference in the jobs that you are going to be offered because streams aren't
listed on your degree. They are only mentioned in your transcript. A list of all
the streams offered to Computer Science Honours students is available on the 
[Admissions website](https://admissions.carleton.ca/degrees/computer-science/) and
their required courses can be found on your 
[Academic Calendar](http://calendar.carleton.ca/undergrad/undergradprograms/computerscience/).
