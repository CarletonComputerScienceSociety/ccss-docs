<h1>Group Work</h1>

  Most people that I've come across in my years of university hate group work.
When I question why they hate group work, I found that people
mostly only hate **bad** group work. Well there's a couple of things I want to put
out there to make group work easier for people to do.

<h2>The word "Group"</h2>
  My favourite definition of the word group comes from [BusinessDictionary.com.](http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/group.html)
They define a group as "A collection of individuals who have regular contact and
frequent interaction, mutual influence, common feeling of camaraderie, and who
work together to achieve a common set of goals". This is what I find is the most
applicable definition of group for the purposes of a group project for a
university course. All of the points for a good group are inside that definition.

<h2>Regular Contact and Frequent Interaction</h2>
  Nothing holds back work more than texting someone and asking them how your
code should interact with their code and them not getting back to you until
three days after. You just lost three days of work due to no fault of your own.
That's not a sustainable way to do a group project. Frequent interaction also
doesn't mean being available all the time. What I suggest is having a time block
where you're available everyday and when you will respond to all questions. This
can probably be the same time that you work on the project. Regular meetings are
incredibly helpful.

<h2>Mutual Influence</h2>
  This is a complex phrase with a lot of substance. There's a easy definition of
it that captures most of the substance. Mutual Influence is defined as
interactional partners taking account of each other's characteristics and
behaviour, and thus influencing each other's behaviour in interaction. This is
really important for making sure that your group doesn't fall apart. You can't
expect your group partners to have the same social interaction style, work ethic
and coding style as you. The advice I have for this is either treat your group
partners as if they're friends, or treat them as colleagues. If your group is
composed of your friends, remember working together is not the same as hanging
out together because all of you will probably have differing views on things and
some conversations or meetings will get really tense. Arguments about work are
alright but they shouldn't bleed into your friendship . I've seen way too many
friendships broken due to a group project gone wrong. I'll list a couple of
things one should keep in mind when you're in an argument -
1. There are no stupid questions is always a good group policy to have.
2. Treat everybody in your team as an equal.
3. Nobody cares about your GPA/CGPA. If you can't win an argument with words,
   don't try to shut it down with a number.
4. Winning the argument is not as important as coming up with the best solution.
   Trust me, winning an argument may feel good but it isn't worth 10% of your
   grade.

<h2>Common feeling of camaraderie</h2>
  Camaraderie is high at the start of a project but as the semester goes through
a lot of people lose their drive. This adversely affects the project and can be
toxic to the other group members. This is really hard to deal with. One solution
I like for getting rid of this is celebration. Set milestones for your project
and every time you reach one, celebrate with your team and de-stress. For a day,
forget what you have left to do and celebrate what you have already accomplished.

<h2>Work together</h2>
  Working together is not necessary but it makes the project easier. Working
together cuts a lot of time because if you have a question about something that
is required for whatever you're currently working on, it can be discussed and
answered right then and there. Another way of working together is Pair
Programming. In pair programming, one person writes code while another reviews
the code being written. This helps catch a lot of bugs before they get buried
within a bunch of code. You can switch the code writer and reviewer whenever the
person writing code needs a break. This also cuts down time when you're stuck on
some problem because two heads will almost certainly come up with an answer
faster than one.

<h2>Common set of goals</h2>
  It's incredibly important to set the goals of the project before you start
working on it. This makes sure that everyone is sure what exactly they're
working towards. You don't want the person developing the database to think
that he's building it for storing films while everybody else is building a
music storage application. It's also important to do this collaboratively so
everyone feels like they are part of a group and not just a coder that got an
assignment.
