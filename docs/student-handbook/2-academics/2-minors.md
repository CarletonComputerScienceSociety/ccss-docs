<h1>Minors? But aren't they more work?</h1>

Here is a [list of minors](http://admissions.carleton.ca/minors/)
available at Carleton.

  A minor is a way to show your interest in another field. It's also
a way to learn about another subject important to your field of work.
For example, a Game Dev student might minor in Physics because they are
interested in accurately simulating physics in alternate worlds.

A minor will show up on your transcript and degree.


<h2>Do minors really add more work?</h2>

Well, no.  Minor credits consume your electives, so it's more like
restricting which courses you take as electives.  They don't add to
the amount of credits required overall.
You may add, change or remove a minor to your degree at any time.  If
you find you are taking most of your electives in one field, maybe
adding a minor only adds a couple extra courses.

Not sure if a certain minor will fit with the courses you are taking?
Why not run a ["What If" audit](http://carleton.ca/sasc/advisingcentre/audit/what-if-audit/)?
