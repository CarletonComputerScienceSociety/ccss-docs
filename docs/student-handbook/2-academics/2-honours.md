<h1>What's so honourable about honours?</h2>

Attaching an Honours to your degree is a way to show a greater interest in
academia in the field of Computer Science. It adds a couple of courses over the
general degree and you can choose to add a stream on top of that. I want to let you all know that Honours is 
**not** a requirement for getting a good job in the Computer Science industry.
It is good for people that are interested in going into a Masters program and/or
are interested in research in the field of Computer Science or have an interest
in a particular stream that is offered at Carleton.
