<h1>Version Control - Like... v0.1?</h1>

You've probably written code before in a high-school course or just in your own
free time, maybe even with partners. What a trip right? I remember in both
high-school and first year when I had projects that got bigger than I expected.
How do you keep track of all the changes you made? How do you keep track of
that one thing you changed that seemed experimentally good? How do you fix all
those changes back when it turns out that was exactly what you didn't need. Not
to mention all of your partners ~~app-breaking~~ code? Luckily for you there's
a wonderful answer that takes care of all these things and more!

Version control!

## What is it?

It's a phrase you've likely heard before. Essentially a set of development
practices combined with a piece of software or two that will allow you, and
your whole team, to be able to keep all sorts of funky development issues in
check.

## The Basics

You get yourself some version control software that the whole team can use.
There are plenty of options for version control that are great (like *Git*,
*Subversion*, and a whole [whack of
others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_revision_control_software)) but
all in all if you want to get into this right after this I'll take the headache
of choosing out for you: learn to use Git. I'll get a little deeper into why
that's my choice as the article goes on.

Once you've all got the same VC tool wherever you're developing you need to
decide how you're all going to use it together to keep things in check. Sound
like a big task? Don't worry, plenty of people have all found exceptional ways
to solve the problems you have or are going to have.

Get coding and use those processes and software you just grabbed to do it in a
smooth-as-butter fashion.

In the tl;dr: form, that's literally it to keep the code portion of your
project in check. Now let's get into more meat and bones.

## The Software

Version Control (or Revision Control) software essentially all does the same
thing:

- Saves multiple states of your project and files in your project
- Allows you to view, modify, work from, and combine any of these states

It doesn't sound like much, but it's an incredibly powerful tool when you use
it correctly. I like using Git for this because it does it with more options
for fine-tuned control than any other VC software I've used (and embarrassingly
enough I've even used Dropbox once upon a time).

I could try and take up the entire history and purpose of version control here,
but it's been written before and by smarter people than I, so have yourself a
[link](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control) to
some more in-depth stuff if you'd like (and I recommend it).

## The Practices

The next most powerful part of Version Control is your VC practices. This
includes projects that you are working on just by yourself but is essential to
projects that you'll be developing within a team.

It comes down to how you and members of your team are going to save states in
your project and how you will combine your work together. This is important for
a variety of reasons and the most common of them are:

- Prevent your work clobbering important changes someone else made.
- Finding who introduced a bug in the code, when, and where.
- Keeping all those bugs out of the version that is currently released.
- Trying something new without breaking what you already have.

Again, there are much better resources on this than I could go into in detail
here so for some expert tested best practices check out [this one for
Git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows). If you
decide on different VC software, there are plenty of resources on best
practices for the platform as well.

## Learn More

There's only so much I can teach you in a little article like this so it's
going to be up to you to get practiced and ready. Luckily I know of a few
resources that *really* helped me to become competent at VC (and it's saved my
butt on an assignment more than once).

If you're choosing Git (dooooo it) then take start with these ones:

- [Atlassian Git Tutorials](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials)
- [Git Software Documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc)

If you're going to give SVN a shot then I've dug up these ones that I think
will be helpful:

- [TutorialsPoint SVN Introduction](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/svn)
- [Open Source SVN book](http://svnbook.red-bean.com)

And always **always** remember your good friend [Stack
Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) for those things you just can't figure out
yourself!

In addition to all of these things, the CCSS occasionally runs some Git
workshops near the beginning of semesters. They're frequently hosted by Yours
Truly!

Happy coding readers! I hope this is a good starting point for you to have the
best managed projects of your year and eventually your career!
