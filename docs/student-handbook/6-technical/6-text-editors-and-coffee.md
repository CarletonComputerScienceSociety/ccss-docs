<h1> Meet your new best friends </h1>
A computer science student should never be caught without two things: coffee and
code. One of the things that you need to write code is a **text editor**. A text
editor is a piece of software that allows you to write text. The simplest
text editor would be Notepad. But, as you'll find, Notepad has pretty poor support
for anything more than writing down notes (no automatic indentation, syntax
linting, etc.)

So what should you use? As I'm writing this, I'm using the GitHub Atom editor,
and it is a really friendly first editor. It is fast, stable, and very
conventional in terms of its editing style. But the important thing is that you
find an editor you like, and you love it, because when you write code you're
gonna be using this piece of software for at least a couple hours at a time.

> * Emacs: Emacs is Vim's counterpart in the holy war, with a similar learning

> * Sublime Text: Sublime Text is very similar to Atom, but is a piece of paid
> software.

<h2> Coffee </h2>
Now, on to the other half. Coffee. Carleton has some of the highest coffee per
capita for a university (11 coffee shops in total). Go find them yourself with this [list.](http://dining.carleton.ca/locations/)
