<h1> The Interview </h1>

So - you've worked tirelessly on your resume, you've sent it out to a million
places, and it all comes down to this - the interview! Programming interviews,
especially at larger companies, are thought to be terrifying and scary
experiences.
Technical interviews can be scary, but they are a skill. And like any
skill, with practice, anyone can be awesome at it.

<h2>CCSS Top 5 Interview Tips</h2>
* Do your research! Knowing about a company is a great way to show that you want the job and is a great conversation starter.
* Try and de-formalize the situation. Interviews are only as scary as you make them! Find common ground and use the interviewer's questions
as a hint of how they want the conversation to go. Remember to make
the interview a _conversation_, not a question and answer period.
* Study up on common interview problems from the suggested sites in the sidebar, but don't memorize. Anyone who has interviewed someone
before can tell when you're pretending to struggle with a problem.
If you've seen a problem before, be polite and honest about it.
Obviously, you should still make sure they know you know the solution.
Practice coding on a whiteboard.
* Make sure you want to work at the company if they want to hire you.
An interview is just as much about you checking that you feel like you
want to spend forty hours a week at this company as it is about if
they want to hire you!
* Most importantly, think out loud! An interviewer can't see inside
your head while you're doing a question, and they're looking for you
to give information about how you would solve a problem, not just that
you can get the answer. Think of this like showing your work in maths
class, but verbally. If you have a whiteboard during the interview,
 use it!
