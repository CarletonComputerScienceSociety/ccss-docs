<h1>Co-op (Not the Gaming Kind)</h1>

So you are in co-op.  Or you are interested in co-op.  Or you want
to make lots of money all day erry day (who doesn’t?).

If you are in first year, there's not a whole lot to do.  The co-op
office will invite you to an information session near the end of the
year. Just chill.

For the typical co-op student, any work for the co-op program begins
in second year.  In Fall, you will work through COOP 1000, an online
zero-credit course.  Pro-tip for COOP 1000: Complete as much of the
course as you can in September, before your other courses
start piling up.
