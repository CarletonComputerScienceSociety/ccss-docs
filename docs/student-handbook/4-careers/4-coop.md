<h1>Co-op (Not the Gaming Kind)</h1>

So you are in co-op.  Or you are interested in co-op.  Or you want
to make lots of money all day erry day (who doesn’t?).

If you are in first year, there's not a whole lot to do.  The co-op
office will invite you to an information session near the end of the
year. Just chill, don't worry, they *will* get to you.

For the typical co-op student, any work for the co-op program begins
in second year.  In Fall, you will work through COOP 1000, an online
zero-credit course.  Pro-tip for COOP 1000: Complete as much of the
course as you can in September, before your other courses
start piling up.

<h2> Pros and Cons </h2>
<h3>Cons</h3>
* Co-op costs money
* COOP 1000 is extra work
* You have to write a pesky work-term report
* You don’t need co-op to find work
* They send you an annoying amount of e-mails
* No CUSA health plan, Carleton gym membership, etc. during work terms
* If you keep your entrance scholarship, you need to work things out with the Rewards Office

<h3>Pros</h3>
* You make back the co-op fees and much more with your first pay
* Co-op makes it *significantly* easier to find work
* The high placement rate for CS means you have to try to not get a job in order to not get a job.
* Some jobs are only available through the co-op job board
* Co-op provides services like resume reviews, rooms for interviews
* You still get your U-Pass during Fall or Winter work terms

Tip: You might be able to turn what you want to do into a
co-op work term, you just need to ask.
