<h1> Just Apply! </h1>
It might seem like a company doesn't want to hire you, but they hire people to
figure out if they want to hire you, and you're not those people! So apply to
as many jobs that you think you'd be interested in (and maybe even some you
think you wouldn't be, you never know how things actually work for them
internally).
