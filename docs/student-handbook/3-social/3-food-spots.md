> 1. Roosters - Coffee cheaper than Tim’s! Get your breakfast wrap with extra veggies for super cheap.
> 2. Residence Cafeteria.  No really, all you can eat for 10$ before 4:00 pm.  Once you live off campus, it’s great not to have to do your own dishes and cooking. You pay ten dollars and you sit there for half an hour and then stuff your face and then you can have five desserts. I like having an off-campus meal plan.
> 3. Subway - good bang for your buck. You can get a 12-inch sandwich that’ll feed you all day for like $8. Get all the veggies.
Leo’s Lounge - This little corner of Mackenzie run by the Engineering Society is a great place to get cheap food!
> 4. Tim Horton’s - Come grab a sandwich and some sweet, sweet coffee. Sandwiches and soup/chilli are only available at the River and Residence Commons Tim Horton’s.
> <p>The worst: Starbucks.  Both. They are franchised and basically not a real Starbucks.</p>
