<h1> Top 5 Food Spots</h1>

[Hours of Operation](http://dining.carleton.ca/hours-of-operation/) for Dining Services.

<dl>
	<dt> Rooster's </dt>
	<dd> Coffee cheaper than Tim's!  Get your breakfast wrap with extra veggies for super cheap, and fill'er up.</dd>

	<dt> Residence Cafeteria (Fresh Food Co.) </dt>
	<dd> No really, all-you-can-eat.  If you show up before 4:00, then it's only about 10$.  Once you live off campus, it's wonderful to not have to cook or do any dishes.  You can stuff your face and eat five desserts and stay as long as you like. </dd>

	<dt> Subway </dt>
	<dd> The best bang for your buck.  You can get a 12" sandwich that will feed you all day. </dd>

	<dt> Leo's Lounge </dt>
	<dd> The Engineering Society sells great food for very cheap, like samosas.  The catch is that you need to navigate Mackenzie Building to find their lounge, but well worth the struggle. </dd>

	<dt> Tim Horton's </dt>
	<dd> We all know and love/hate Tim Horton's.  The only on-campus Tim's with sandwiches and soup are in River Building and Residence Commons.  Go half an hour after classes start to beat the line (e.g., 9 am, 10:30 am, 12:00 pm, 1:30 pm...)</dd>

</dl>

The worst: Starbucks. Both of 'em. They are franchises, not real Starbucks.  Don't fall for the trap.
Not gonna lie, the Second Cup is pretty decent, and they have cheap-latte-Tuesday.
