## Issues with grades
Go to your teaching assistant first (look on the course outline). If you and the TA can’t come to a resolution, talk to your professor.

## Accommodation or missed tests
Talk to your professor. They are under no obligation to give you accommodation beyond what’s actually in your course outline (i.e. pregnancy, religion, sickness, etc).

## Missed Exams
Missing an exam is a big deal. If you miss an exam or plan to miss an exam, you **must** talk to the registrar's office as soon as possible! The prof has absolutely no power over centrally scheduled exams and the registrar is the person to talk to!

## Specific streams
* Game Development - David Mould
* Mobile - Tony White

Another great resource is the if-then tree on the last page of the [Referral Guide for Students](http://carleton.ca/studentsupport/wp-content/uploads/CarletonCompleteReferralGuideForStudents.pdf). It isn’t computer science-specific but it contains information on some super important and awesome services that Carleton offers.
