<h1>CCSS Student Handbook</h1>

*and/or survival guide*

## What is this thing?

The student handbook was an idea proposed by Connor Hillen (President
2015/2016) and taken on originally by a handful of your fellow CS students.
It's designed and written to be a collection of useful information that they
definitely don't teach you in class that will help you with your stay at
Carleton University.

Honestly, there's **a lot** of things you need to know to survive and enjoy
University that they don't teach at University... For ~$9000 a year you'd think
that it could be included.

Anyways! Onto what this e-book thing contains:

## Contents

**Chapter 1** - An introduction to this book. Credits and stuff.

**Chapter 2** - Everything(ish) about Academics, from good electives to which
courses are going to <strike>f\*\*\* you up</strike> be hard.

**Chapter 3** - The sociality (or anti-sociality depending on you), of life at
Carleton and living in Ottawa in general.

**Chapter 4** - Careers, and advice on how to get one with the fancy paper
you're paying for.

**Chapter 5** - The CCSS, who we are, what we do for you, and how you can use
us to help you.

**Chapter 6** - Tech stuff. Tips for getting into the right technologies the
right way.

## Go forth!

This book is written for CS posterity. If you learn even more useful things at
CU that this book didn't teach you, add them! It's a thing you can do.

Now onto the knowledge with a short interlude for things like credit.
